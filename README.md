# Using-ArcGIS-API-for-python-to-visualize-and-analyze-covid
ArcGIS API for python was used to visualize covid-19 deaths in Italy

**Objective**
The ArcGIS API for Python can be applied to visualize COVID-19 deaths in Italy using GIS analysis. It illustrates the use of Python to handle, analyze, and visualize geospatial data effectively through the following key aspects:

It contains sections detailing the following processes:

GIS Server Connection: Establishes a connection with a GIS server for accessing and managing geospatial data.
Merge Datasets: Integrates multiple datasets, likely to consolidate various sources of COVID-19 data.
Fatalities Map: Constructs a map visualization to represent COVID-19 fatalities geographically.
Confirmed Cases Map: Generates a map to display the distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
Data Visualization: Focuses on visualizing the data in various formats to aid in the analysis and interpretation of the spread and impact of the virus.
